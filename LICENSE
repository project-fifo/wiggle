<p>            Conditioned upon Your compliance with Section 3.1 below and<br />
            subject to third party intellectual property claims, each<br />
            Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,<br />
            non-exclusive license:</p>

                  combination of Modifications made by that Contributor<br />
                  with other software (except as part of the<br />

                  Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the<br />
                  absence of Modifications made by that Contributor. </p>
<p>      3. Distribution Obligations.</p>
<p>            3.1. Availability of Source Code.</p>
<p>            Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make<br />
            available in Executable form must also be made available in<br />
            Source Code form and that Source Code form must be<br />
            distributed only under the terms of this License. You must<br />
            include a copy of this License with every copy of the<br />
            Source Code form of the Covered Software You distribute or<br />
            otherwise make available. You must inform recipients of any<br />
            such Covered Software in Executable form as to how they can<br />
            obtain such Covered Software in Source Code form in a<br />
            reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used<br />
            for software exchange.</p>
<p>            3.2. Modifications.</p>
<p>            The Modifications that You create or to which You<br />
            contribute are governed by the terms of this License. You<br />
            represent that You believe Your Modifications are Your<br />
            original creation(s) and/or You have sufficient rights to<br />
            grant the rights conveyed by this License.</p>
<p>            3.3. Required Notices.</p>
<p>            You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications<br />
            that identifies You as the Contributor of the Modification.<br />
            You may not remove or alter any copyright, patent or<br />
            trademark notices contained within the Covered Software, or<br />
            any notices of licensing or any descriptive text giving<br />
            attribution to any Contributor or the Initial Developer.</p>
<p>            3.4. Application of Additional Terms.</p>
<p>            You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered<br />
            Software in Source Code form that alters or restricts the<br />
            applicable version of this License or the recipients'<br />
            rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to charge a<br />
            fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability<br />
            obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software.<br />
            However, you may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on<br />
            behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You<br />
            must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty,<br />
            support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by<br />
            You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial<br />
            Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred<br />
            by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of<br />
            warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.</p>
<p>            3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.</p>
<p>            You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered<br />
            Software under the terms of this License or under the terms<br />
            of a license of Your choice, which may contain terms<br />
            different from this License, provided that You are in<br />
            compliance with the terms of this License and that the<br />
            license for the Executable form does not attempt to limit<br />
            or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code form<br />
            from the rights set forth in this License. If You<br />
            distribute the Covered Software in Executable form under a<br />
            different license, You must make it absolutely clear that<br />
            any terms which differ from this License are offered by You<br />
            alone, not by the Initial Developer or Contributor. You<br />
            hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every<br />
            Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial<br />
            Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms<br />
            You offer.</p>
<p>            3.6. Larger Works.</p>
<p>            You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software<br />
            with other code not governed by the terms of this License<br />
            and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such<br />
            a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License<br />
            are fulfilled for the Covered Software. </p>
<p>      4. Versions of the License. </p>
<p>            4.1. New Versions.</p>
<p>            Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial license steward and<br />
            may publish revised and/or new versions of this License<br />
            from time to time. Each version will be given a<br />
            distinguishing version number. Except as provided in<br />
            Section 4.3, no one other than the license steward has the<br />
            right to modify this License. </p>
<p>            4.2. Effect of New Versions.</p>
<p>            You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise<br />
            make the Covered Software available under the terms of the<br />
            version of the License under which You originally received<br />
            the Covered Software. If the Initial Developer includes a<br />
            notice in the Original Software prohibiting it from being<br />
            distributed or otherwise made available under any<br />
            subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and<br />
            make the Covered Software available under the terms of the<br />
            version of the License under which You originally received<br />
            the Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to<br />
            use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software<br />
            available under the terms of any subsequent version of the<br />
            License published by the license steward. </p>
<p>            4.3. Modified Versions.</p>
<p>            When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a<br />
            new license for Your Original Software, You may create and<br />
            use a modified version of this License if You: (a) rename<br />
            the license and remove any references to the name of the<br />
            license steward (except to note that the license differs<br />
            from this License); and (b) otherwise make it clear that<br />
            the license contains terms which differ from this License.</p>
<p>      5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.</p>
<p>      COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS"<br />
      BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,<br />
      INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED<br />
      SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR<br />
      PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND<br />
      PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY<br />
      COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE<br />
      INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF<br />
      ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF<br />
      WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF<br />
      ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS<br />
      DISCLAIMER. </p>
<p>      6. TERMINATION. </p>
<p>            6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will<br />
            terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms<br />
            herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of<br />
            becoming aware of the breach. Provisions which, by their<br />
            nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of<br />
            this License shall survive.</p>
<p>            6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding<br />
            declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or<br />
            a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against<br />
            whom You assert such claim is referred to as "Participant")<br />
            alleging that the Participant Software (meaning the<br />
            Contributor Version where the Participant is a Contributor<br />
            or the Original Software where the Participant is the<br />
            Initial Developer) directly or indirectly infringes any<br />
            patent, then any and all rights granted directly or<br />
            indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial<br />
            Developer (if the Initial Developer is not the Participant)<br />
            and all Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this<br />
            License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant<br />
            terminate prospectively and automatically at the expiration<br />
            of such 60 day notice period, unless if within such 60 day<br />
            period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the<br />
            Participant Software against such Participant either<br />
            unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with<br />
            Participant.</p>
<p>            6.3. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2<br />
            above, all end user licenses that have been validly granted<br />
            by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination<br />
            (excluding licenses granted to You by any distributor)<br />
            shall survive termination.</p>
<p>      7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.</p>
<p>      UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT<br />
      (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE<br />
      INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF<br />
      COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE<br />
      LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR<br />
      CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT<br />
      LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK<br />
      STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER<br />
      COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN<br />
      INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF<br />
      LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL<br />
      INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT<br />
      APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO<br />
      NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR<br />
      CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT<br />
      APPLY TO YOU.</p>
<p>      8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.</p>
<p>      The Covered Software is a "commercial item," as that term is<br />
      defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial<br />
      computer software" (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. ¤<br />
      252.227-7014(a)(1)) and "commercial computer software<br />
      documentation" as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept.<br />
      1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1<br />
      through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users<br />
      acquire Covered Software with only those rights set forth herein.<br />
      This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu of, and supersedes,<br />
      any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision that addresses<br />
      Government rights in computer software under this License.</p>
<p>      9. MISCELLANEOUS.</p>
<p>      This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject<br />
      matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be<br />
      unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the<br />
      extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be<br />
      governed by the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice<br />
      contained within the Original Software (except to the extent<br />
      applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding such<br />
      jurisdiction's conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation<br />
      relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of<br />
      the courts located in the jurisdiction and venue specified in a<br />
      notice contained within the Original Software, with the losing<br />
      party responsible for costs, including, without limitation, court<br />
      costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The<br />
      application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the<br />
      International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or<br />
      regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall<br />
      be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.<br />
      You agree that You alone are responsible for compliance with the<br />
      United States export administration regulations (and the export<br />
      control laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use,<br />
      distribute or otherwise make available any Covered Software.</p>
<p>      10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.</p>
<p>      As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is<br />
      responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or<br />
      indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License<br />
      and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to<br />
      distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing<br />
      herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission<br />
      of liability.</p>
